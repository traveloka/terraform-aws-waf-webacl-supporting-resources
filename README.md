# terraform-aws-waf-webacl-supporting-resources
This repository contains a module to create several resources needed by AWS WAF WebACL to:
* Enable logging of traffic information[[1]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html).
* Store logs in Parquet format[[2]](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Parquet) for more optimized query using Athena[[3]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/columnar-storage.html).
* Provision query-ready Athena Database and Table.

Based on the diagram above, the resources going to be created are:
* S3 Bucket to store all traffic logs.
* Kinesis Data Firehose[[4]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html) to deliver traffic logs from WAF WebACL to the S3.
* Cloudwatch Log Group and Stream to store the Firehose delivery error information.
* AWS Glue Catalog Database and Table which store metadata/schema of the log data.
    * One function of those resources is to make it possible the conversion from JSON to Parquet.
    * The other function is to provision Amazon Athena Database and Table which is ready to use to perform queries.
* IAM Role and Permissions for the Firehose to do all those actions above.

*Please Note:* This module **WILL NOT CREATE** AWS WAF Rules and WebACL. 

If you are wondering what kind of rules you should create to protect your App, you might want to take a look at [Related Modules](#related-modules) section below.

Also, to get a full picture on how to make use of this module together with AWS WAF WebACL and Rules, check [Examples](#examples) section.
