# regional
An example on how to use this module to create WAF regional resources to protect ALB or API Gateway

Additional resources like OWASP Top 10 security protection rules are created using [terraform-aws-waf-owasp-top-10-rules](https://github.com/traveloka/terraform-aws-waf-owasp-top-10-rules).

It will also show you how to create WebACL, adding the rules into it, and create its association with ALB and API Gateway.

For AWS WAF on Cloudfront is a little bit different, you can see the example here: [waf global: for Cloudfront](../global)
